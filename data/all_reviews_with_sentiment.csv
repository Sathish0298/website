"Rating: 3, Comments: Pros: Nice packaging and excellent next day delivery was given.

FeedBack: The machine can be used to measure BP for personal usage and assist in deciding if the doctor visit is required or not. My recommendation will be to take 5 readings at a gap of 3-4 minutes between readings. When I have tested it, the readings came in this order:
120/81  
109/79
129/82
117/79
112/78
While measuring the BP, the fluctuations were there of +-20 on the very first day. It was difficult to decide which one is right reading. I will try taking some readings for few days and will check the reliability of electronic BP measuring machines for accurately measuring BP. I hope the device is not faulty giving the variation of +-20 in its readings, as I have used the one in my office which shows the variation of +-2 only in its readings.",negative

"Rating: 5, Comments: After being diagnosed with type 1 hypertension, I purchased the bp710 Omron BP710 3 Series‚Ñ¢ Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitorto keep track of my daily pressure and to see results of my efforts to avoid medication through life style changes. When I started measuring, the results seemed a bit higher than what doctors measured. It did show me trends though, which was very helpful. To determine its accuracy, I measured my pressure before and after my last heart doctor appointment to compare to the pressure measured by my doctor. The Systolic measurement from the Omron unit was slightly higher than the doctor measurement, while the diastolic measurement was much closer to the doctor measurement. Since then, I have found that with the Omron unit, I have to put on the armband but then sit near motionless while using relax breathing for a few minutes prior to starting the unit. This technique produced results that are much more inline with the doctor measurements. While accurate when doing this, it took experimentation to learn a technique that worked for me. The Omron Bp710 is well worth the investment to know what is and is not working with my life style changes.",positive

The best thing about omron is that unlike other brands most of the advanced features are available in the entry level omron products as well. This one offers Intellisence technology which offers accurate results by adjusting according to the usage pattern and room temperature. 

Moreover it is highly easy to use with just single button results. Just wear it and switch it on and you get the results. It gives your diastolic, systolic pressure and pulse as well as save the previous 5-6 readings.

With this BP monitor you can rest assured of accurate results and what's more it is highly affordable at Snapdeal.

Just go for it...",positive

I found both are matching exactly. In fact ""omeron"" gives more accurate value in the sence usually your physician or lab technician will round off pressure value to nearest multiple of ""ten"". ie they will never say ""your bp is 87-115"" . Instead of it they will quote your bp as 90-120. Hence always go for a digital one for domestic purpose.only thing you have to do is just compare the values shown by digital 
one with mercury sphygmomanometer once in a while, say once in six months or one year.",positive

"Rating: 5, Comments: The device is bit bulky but does well what it is designed for. There are some instructions that we need to follow to get accurate results. People who are getting unreliable results might not be following it properly. I took multiple readings in 3 min gaps and found correct results.
The body movement indicator and hypertension ind work perfectly.
4 alkaline batteries come with the device so you can start using right away. There is a 6V adapter port but you need to buy it yourself if required.
The start/stop button is soft touch though, which might cause it to turn on inside the package if batteries are in it. Else, there is no issue. It is a basic device with single memory and no bells and whistles. I definitely recommend it.
The seller shipped via express, I got it within 1 and half days of ordering. Also, the device was packed inside its own carton in bubble wrap hence no damage. Quite good.",positive

"Rating: 5, Comments: Nice .getting exact results.nice for that price.....",positive
"Rating: 5, Comments: I went for this product, particularly impressed with its price. The build quality is good and it performs very well - with an omron you can be sure of quality. However one major disappointment, which if mentioned or known earlier, would have altered my decision:
This machine comes with a single arm band (generally other machines have two bands, for different arm sizes) - and the single arm band does not fit large arms and thus one cannot measure the bp of people with healthier arms. Now that is a serious limitation and makes the price not worth the limitation.
I suggest one should go in for a set with two arm bands, so that all arm sizes can have their bp measures else the machine usage is seriously restricted. The arm band with this machine is of small size and arm circumference over 25 cm cannot have their bp measured!",negative

"Rating: 5, Comments: good",positive
"Rating: 2, Comments: The product is handy and very easy to use. The reading sometime appears to be incorrect as it shows significant variance on multiple use keeping other factors unchanged within a short time period. The biggest drawback however is the size of the arm-cuff, which restricts its use to very limited/specific size. I think the range of the arm-cuff should be more. And I am unable to get additional arm-cuff (bigger size) in the open market, so its not much of use to me.",negative

"Rating: 5, Comments: Surely there will be difference between manual sphygnomanometer and digital one (around 5 mm Hg).But one who requires regular bp monitoring should get this and should also get it checked it by a physician so that you can know its error range.You should also be careful to keep your arm at heart level and be relaxed for few minutes before checking.It can also vary with different arms.If difference is more then check it with your physician.The cuff caters to arms of MUAC upto 32 cm.So obese people shouldn't buy this...that's it. Thanks",positive

"Rating: 1, Comments: i bought this product after looking at a lot of reviews. i decided on this because whether it was a low priced product or a higher priced one, there were reviews in both cases which mentioned inaccurate readings. so i thought it was better to spend less and be inaccurate than more. and while i was hoping for the best, what i got only confirmed my worst fears. this machine is giving me a difference of up to 14 points in systolic and close to 8 points in diastolic in successive readings with a time gap of less than 3 minutes and this is happening time and again. so i will soon be writing to omron to resolve this issue.",negative
"Rating: 5, Comments: Best product",positive
"Rating: 4, Comments: It is easy to use and there is only one button to start and  stop the item and pretty simple to attach and operate relevant parts. However, unlike my wrist digital BP monitor it doesn't have a clour indicator showing whether the reading is at the higher side or normal or lower side. It doens't also catch irregular heartbeat like my omron wrist digital BP minitor. It runs on 6 AA batteries and its good that it can be run on electricity also but the adapter doesn't come along with this device.",negative

"Rating: 4, Comments: it is difficult to say at this point of time it can be said after using for few months and check the accuracy of the instrument by comparing with the similar type of machine. At times it has been seen that for few months the product is alright after that it starts misbehaving.
Give us few months and ask the me question to get a correct picture",negative

"Rating: 4, Comments: At the outset, I must say I am very happy with this product, though I was somewhat apprehensive about it after reading some reviews and with reference to the common belief that such digital devices are not accurate. This BP Monitor gives good results within acceptable tolerance. If one keeps in mind that such devices are meant to check one's BP at home as a preliminary step to know whether there is a need to go to a doctor, this instrument is admirably the suitable one. I find that it is very very easy to use. No need to have any previous experience or skill. Just simple press of a button. Two thoughtful features:1.Indicates if the reading is beyond normal range,  and 2. Indicates irregular heart beat, thus telling that one should see the doctor. If the cuff is placed on the arm at heart level, as indicated in the leaflet, the results are good.",positive

We are quite unsure about the accuracy of the monitor. Since we believe that it has a competitive quality among the top brands for BP monitors, we are understanding that the numbers are near to accurate, yet not exact!Recommended for the ones who need to check BP frequently, as you would get idea of how accurate it would be, by keep checking your BP with doctor and comparing your machine's results.

I tried to register for warranty for the Omron B.P. Monitor HEM-7120, bought online through Amazon on 07-Feb-2024. The machine is working fine. But, when I tried to register the machine with the Company, I got a message that Warranty will be registered only if the purchase is made through their authorized dealers.This is surprising, since Amazon online figures in their list of regular dealers/agents. Please look into the matter & get my machine registered for Warranty.Dr. S. M. Sapatnekar
